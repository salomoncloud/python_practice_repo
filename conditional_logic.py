# booleans
# creating something that checks your age and license before starting a car, for example
is_old = True
is_licenced = False

if is_old and is_licenced:
    print("you are old enough to drive this car")
else:
    print('You are not eligible to drive')

# truthy values are basically values that are considered true when used in a boolean context
# falsy is the opposite
# look up python truthiness and truth table on google for example
