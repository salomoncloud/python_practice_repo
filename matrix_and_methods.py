# matrix is a way to describe 2D lists - multi-dimensional lists
# ex
matrix = [
    [1,2,3],
    [2,4,6],
    [7,8,9]
]
# in this example we have the main array which is the first pair of square brackets, and than the 2nd containing the numbers
# matrix's are used for ml models and image processing, and they work with 1's and 0's
# to access things in matrix, ex:
print(matrix[0][1])
